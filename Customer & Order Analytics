-- In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

-- #1: How many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> ‘OrderID’;

-- #2: How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> ‘OrderID’
AND Product = ‘iPhone’;

-- #3: Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;

-- #4: Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

-- #5: What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product <> ''
GROUP BY Product

-- #6: Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

-- #7: How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id

-- #8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'OrderID';
